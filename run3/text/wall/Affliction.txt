We might be getting close. See, I found these boxes with a couple gold rings attached to them. Wait, that wasn't the first thing. I'll get back to that later. Before that, I was thinking about the law of action and reaction. These batteries are what, a few grams apiece? If you and the battery were the only things in the equation, there's no way it could pull you around, much less that electromagnet. There has to be something holding the batteries in place. My first thought was air friction, because that's exactly what air friction does. Except no it's not; air friction would apply to you too. Except maybe it is, if you take wind into account. I just don't know, and I haven't sat down to do the math because I've been busy with those boxes I mentioned. Speaking of which, those boxes have a bunch of interesting features. They float in midair and you can push them around, but the important thing is that it's hard to push them in certain directions. Not impossible, just hard. The boxes are a lot like the batteries: they float down the middle of the tunnel, and they resist forces. The simplest explanation is that there's one mechanism that explains both boxes and batteries, and if that's true, we can look at the boxes to learn about the batteries. Which is really convenient, because as I'm sure you've noticed, the batteries like to shut down the moment you touch them. So we went and tested the boxes, and to make a long story short, the boxes are anchored to the tunnel. Same with all these batteries, presumably. So that means you aren't pulling against a couple grams of battery, you're pulling against the whole tunnel, almost. And there's not much you can do, except to...
