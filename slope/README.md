Copy of the popular slope game designed to be hosted anywhere to bypass school blocks! Below I will cover two free and easy methods to clone and host this yourself, however if you wish to play, use either of the following links. If you use this repo, please star it so others can find it, and so I can see if yall want more!

+ [Hosted through Github Pages](https://github.com/cgolden15/Slope-Game)
+ [Hosted through repl.it](https://replit.com/@cgolden15/Slope-Game)
## How to use:
- Using [repl.it](https://repl.it/) is the best free, easy way to host and edit this page, however takes longer to set up.
- Using github pages is probably the simplest(and free!) method, however may be blocked on some computers due to the .io ending of the default urls.

Instructions for both are provided below!

### On repl.it
Fork this Repo through repl.it and use `node unityloader41.js` as your run command. If not prompted to enter a run command, create a ".replit" file and paste `run = "node unityloader41.js"` and `language = "html"` into it. Then just run the repl and enjoy!
